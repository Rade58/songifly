# Some thing I noticed about authentication

## Yo ucan use refresh token

when user is already authenticated, somewhere in some useeffect hook you can set up a interval, and regenerate (reset) a json web token, because we would also set up expiration on the cookie

this we would do for experience of the user, so he doesn't need to login every time cookie expires
