# For a production datbase we re going to use PostgreSQL deployed on Heroku

LOGIN TO HEROKU FIRST; GGO TO /apps

MAKE A NEW APP (YES WVEN E WNT TO CREATE DATABASE, YOU NEED TO CREATE A HEROKU APP) (MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NAME IS GLOBALLY UNIQUE)

YOU SHOULD BE IN APPS DASBOARD

# LETS MAKE A CLOUD POSTGRES INSTANCE

IN THE PROJECT DASBOARD GO TO `Resources` TAB

SEARCH INSIDE `Add-ons` FIELD; TYPE `"postgres"`

**YOU SHOULD SEE `Heroku Postgres`**; **Click on that**

OFCOURSE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY; YOU PICK UP `Hobby developer program`

THIS WILL CREATE INSTANCE OF POSTGRES ON SOME AMAON SERVER (HEROKU USES AMAZON INFRASTRUCTURE)

## CONNECTION URI FOR YOUR DATABASE

CLICK ON YOUR DATBASE

GO TO TAB: `Settings`

THEN GO TO `view Credentials`

YOU SHOULD EE THE `URI`

COPY THAT AND PAT IT TO `.env.production` (I WANT TO USE THIS DATBASE AS A PRODUCTION ONE)
