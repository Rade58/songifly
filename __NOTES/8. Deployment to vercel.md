# Deployment to vercel

Going to deploy this through vercel dasboard ("Connecting" your project github repo to vercel)

We start by creating a new project on vercel; the rest should be intuitive

## Also, we should chane default build command

Instead of just `next build` WE WANT TO HAVE 

```
npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && next build`

```
