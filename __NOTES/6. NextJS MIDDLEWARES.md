# MIDDLEWARES

***

TO BE CLEAR: THESE ARE NOT EXPRESS MIDDLEWARES

***

THESE ARE **EDGE FUNCTIONS** (SIMILAR TO AWS LAMBDA OR CLOUDFLARE WORKERS), I AM GOING TO USE IN THIS PROJECT

**THIS EDGE FUNCTION IS NOT IN NODEJS ENVIRONMENT; ALSO IT DOSEN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH FRONTEND; IT IS NOT IN A NODE ENVIRONMENT LIKE OUR DATBASE SEED SCRIPT; `IT IS MORE LIKE A WEB WORKER ENVIRONMENT`**

I AM GOING TO USE THEM FOR AUTHENTICATION

READ MORE ABOUT THEM [OVER HERE](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware)

# I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW I USED MIDDLEWARES IN THIS PROJECT

**YOU CAN DEFINE MIDDLEWARE FOR YOUR API ROUTE, YOU ALSO CAN DEFINE MIDDLEWARE IN FRONT OF YOUR PAGES**

**IN DOCS THEY DIDN'T MENTIONED THAT YOU NEED UNDERSCORE FOR THE MIDDLEWARE: LIKE THIS _middleware**

SO I CREATED `middleware.ts` FILE
