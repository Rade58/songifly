# SOME THINGS I NOTICE ABOUT PRISMA

## Push vs Migration

THEY ARE THE SAME BUT Push **DOESN'T CREATE MIGRATION HISTORY**

## You can have many to many relations

<https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations>

```prisma
model Artist {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  name      String   @unique

  // THIS NEEDS TO BE HERE WHEN WE DEFINE RELATION BELLOW
  // IN A PERSPECTIVE OF Artist
  // one Artist instance can have array like rlation to many Songs
  // MENAING THAT ONE ARTIST CAN HAVE MANY SONGS
  songs Song[]

}

model Song {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  name      String
  
  // THIS IS THE MAJOR PART WHEN WE ARE DEFINING
  // ONE TO MANY RELATION
  // IN A PERSSPECTIVE OF Song
  // one Song instance can relate to just one Artist instance
  artist    Artist   @relation(fields: [artistId], references: [id])
  artistId  Int


  // BUT WE CAN HAV MANY TO MANY RELATION
  // ONE SONG CAN HAVE MANY PLAYLISTS RELATED TO IT

}


model Playlist {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  name      String

  // THAT MEANS ONE PLAYLIST CAN HAVE MANY
  // SONGS RELATED TO IT

}

```
