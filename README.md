# Songifly

<https://songifly.vercel.app>

Project bootstraped with `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`

A spotify clone (to some extent) built with Nextjs, Tailwind (DaisyUI), PostgreSQL

inspired by <https://github.com/Hendrixer/fullstack-music>

Completed:

- auth logic

- spotify audio player logic

Out of scope: everything else; because building exact spotify clone would be time consuming
