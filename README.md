# Songifly

<https://songifly.vercel.app>

Project bootstraped with `npx create-next-app@latest --ts`

A spotify clone (to some extent) that plays some of royalty free songs; built with Nextjs, Xstate, TailwindCSS (DaisyUI component library), PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)

inspired by <https://github.com/Hendrixer/fullstack-music>

Completed:

- auth logic

- spotify audio player logic

Out of scope:

- everything else on spotify; because building exact spotify clone requires time I do not have.
